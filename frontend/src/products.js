      "Travis Scott teamed up with Nike to create the Travis Scott x SB Dunk Low PRM QS 'Cactus Jack.' Featuring a patchwork design, the shoe's upper emerges with a tan suede base accented by plaid on the quarter panel and paisley on the overlays. The overlays themselves are designed to wear away and reveal an elephant print, while the lateral side Swoosh sports a pink finish. Cactus Jack branding emerges on the tongue tag, while a rubber outsole is included for traction.",

      "By the time the Air Yeezy 2 SP ‘Red October’ finally launched online with no advance notice in February 2014, Kanye West had already severed all ties with Nike. Though chaos surrounded the shoe’s much-delayed release, the Red Octobers stand out from its two companion colorways. There’s the monochromatic scarlet finish, contrasted only by metallic gold lace tips, and there’s the unique design, which sees the side panels ditch the standard anaconda texture in favor of rows upon rows of small triangular studs.",
